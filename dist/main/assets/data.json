Using an arduino, LEDs, a LCD, and some buttons I recreated the cyclone game from most arcades. LEDs move back and forth, and depending on what color LED you land on awards a certain amount of points. Red awards the least amount of points, then yellow, then green with the most.",

		"intro" : "Homework: To Do List is an app inspired by a project one of my class mates created. The basic premise of the app is that you can add various school related tasks to your overall list. These tasks can be assigned due dates, priority, and a category based on what type of class the task is from. You could then sort by these properties of each task. This was the second app I have released, and building from knowledge acquired from my last app, it is a big improvement. The user experience is greatly streamlined, and there is finally data serialization, which allows the user to save their tasks after the app is closed.",

I also had very limited experience in JavaScript, however through a long development process, I now have pretty extensive abilities within the language.
