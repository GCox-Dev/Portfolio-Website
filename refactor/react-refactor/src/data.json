It features three game modes, with increasing difficulty and point values. As the LED bounces back and forth the player has the chance to use the green play button in order to stop the LED. Depending on the color of the LED, a certain amount of points are awarded. Point values scale with the difficulty. The player has five tries in order to acquire as many points as possible.",
